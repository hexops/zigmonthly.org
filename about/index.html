I want to provide that for them.</p><h1 id=whats-the-relationship-between-zig-monthly-and-zignews>What&rsquo;s the relationship between Zig monthly and zig.news?</h1><p>Zig monthly is a once-a-month publication where I (<a href=https://github.com/slimsag>@slimsag</a>) curate all the latest Zig things I&rsquo;ve seen over the past month from the Zig Discord showcase channels, on zig.news, Twitter, Reddit, etc. and do my best to come up with something that I think faithfully represents everyone&rsquo;s work.</p><p><a href=https://zig.news>zig.news</a> is awesome: it&rsquo;s run by <a href=https://kristoff.it>Loris Cro, VP of community at the Zig Software Foundation</a> and if you&rsquo;re keen to get news about Zig <em>as it comes out</em> - that&rsquo;s a great place to be!</p><p>I had wavered back a forth a bit on whether or not to create Zig monthly at all: there are a <em>lot</em> of challenges (what to feature, how to avoid my own biases, how to make sure it&rsquo;s good for the community and high-quality - while also being sustainable. what tech to use, etc.) With a bit of encouragement from Loris, I finally decided to commit to it.</p><p>Zig monthly will also get posted to <a href=https://zig.news/monthly>https://zig.news/monthly</a> !</p><h1 id=whos-behind-it>Who&rsquo;s behind it?</h1><p>Just <a href=https://github.com/slimsag>me</a> - a one-person team for now :) I&rsquo;m just a big fan of Zig, I do this on the weekends <a href=https://github.com/slimsag>among my other Zig work</a>.</p><h1 id=how-can-i-help>How can I help?</h1><ul><li><a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJEKosqYa2Mfh7MrZVZ3Krm-65LukUF_AZ4T3VQtTYbBbXtw/viewform>Submit projects/articles</a>, especially if it&rsquo;s from a rarer communication channel or something niche you think others haven&rsquo;t seen yet.

In general, though, my thinking is:</p><ol><li>First and foremost I want this to be optimized for people outside the Zig community, the goal is to share how awesome Zig is :) so I&rsquo;ll:<ul><li>Sometimes prioritize broadly appealing projects (visuals, etc.) over things that are less broadly appealing (e.g. a niche Zig library)</li><li>Try to interleave visually-appealing content and word-heavy content, so if you have a cool project but no cool visuals - I&rsquo;ll try to make sure another project&rsquo;s cool visuals come after yours to encourage people to continue reading.</li></ul></li><li>Within the Zig community, it&rsquo;d be cool for this to be a way to surface lesser-known things (that library everyone really should know but doesn&rsquo;t) and lesser-known people.<ul><li>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out the best way to do this!</li></ul></li><li>I want to keep curation & ranking of topics as unbiased as I can. I love Zig, I&rsquo;m working in Zig ~8 hours a day and it&rsquo;s inevitable I&rsquo;ll want to share some of my own work, and so I&rsquo;ll always:<ul><li>Be transparent when I have a bias / affiliation with a project.</li><li>Do my best to come up with an inclusion criteria / metric that can be applied equally to all projects.</li><li>Do my best to elevate others in the Zig community - that&rsquo;s what this is all for!</li></ul></li></ol><p>Please feel free to give me direct/blunt feedback about anything, I want to hear the good and bad: <a href=mailto:stephen@hexops.com>stephen@hexops.com</a></p></div></article><section id=subscribe><h1>Subscribe</h1>Enter your email to get one Zig newsletter per month (or use this <a href=/index.xml>RSS feed</a>):<br><br><form action=https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/zigmonthly method=post target=popupwindow onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/zigmonthly','popupwindow')" class=embeddable-buttondown-form><input type=email name=email id=bd-email placeholder=example@domain.com>
