# zoltan: a minimalist Lua binding 

This month's showcase mention is [@ranciere](https://github.com/ranciere)'s [zoltan project](https://github.com/ranciere/zoltan), a minimalist Lua binding. Use cases:

* Dynamic configuration of the application (you can handle complex configuration cases which involve logic)
* To support user-defined extensions
* To automate repetitive user tasks (Neovim)
* To develop UI business logic (a lot of games do this)

What struck me [about their blog post](https://zig.news/ranciere/zoltan-a-minimalist-lua-binding-4mp4) was the simplicity of the API:

# buztd: Super lightweight process killer

[@vrmiguel](https://github.com/vrmiguel) released [buztd](https://github.com/vrmiguel/buztd), a super lightweight process killer for Linux.

# ZT: ImGui+OpenGL+stb_image+GLFW

Runner up for this month's showcase mention, [@JonSnowbd](https://github.com/JonSnowbd)'s project called [ZT](https://github.com/JonSnowbd/ZT), "A zig-contained library for Windows and Ubuntu that automatically compiles and links ImGui, OpenGL, stb_image, and GLFW into typed packages." which has been in development for over 9 months:

# minz: Minimal string compression

[@judofyr](https://github.com/judofyr) released [minz](https://github.com/judofyr/minz), a minimal string compressor based on the paper [FSST: Fast Random Access String Compression.](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p2649-boncz.pdf)

Highly suggest checking out [the Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zig/comments/sa1pnf/minz_minimal_string_compression/) if this interests you.

# Zig compiling and running a program faster than Python can interpret it

[Andrew Kelley shared](https://twitter.com/andy_kelley/status/1483677253682675713) how the upcoming stage2 Zig compiler can compile an executable from scratch and run it faster than Python can interpret the file on the right:

<a align="center" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/153105034-68134cdc-f206-42ad-91c4-1e7cfcdf887a.png"><img width="650px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/153105034-68134cdc-f206-42ad-91c4-1e7cfcdf887a.png"></img></a>

We're also starting to get the first hints of how Zig's [hot code swapping](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/68) feature will work, with the first successful hot code swap [shown on one of Andrew's recent Twitch streams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zig/comments/s9toy1/we_have_a_working_hot_code_swapping/)!

# Implementing the "Self" programming language in Zig

[@sin-ack](https://github.com/sin-ack) shared [on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/605571803288698900/605572611539206171/939317499139330111) how they're working on an implementation of the Self programming language:

> For about the past 2 months or so, I have been working on an implementation of the Self programming language (https://selflanguage.org/) in Zig. It's been coming along pretty well so far; the language parser, AST, interpreter and VM runtime is now done. For the past couple of weeks I have been working on getting garbage collection (generational scavenging GC) right and for the past couple of days I've been doing performance work. Feel free to ask me anything :^)

# Visualizing how rasterization works on modern GPUs

[@MichalZiulek](https://twitter.com/MichalZiulek) is back again with more incredible DirectX graphics demos, [this time showing](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/sest9c/see_how_gpu_rasterizer_works_in_slow_motion_gtx/) how GPU reasterization of triangles works in slow motion ("This works by capturing render output to a transient buffer and then playing it back at human-discernable speed."):

# zmath & introduction to zig-gamedev DirectX applications

The other two notable mentions from Michal are:

* [zmath 0.2](https://github.com/michal-z/zig-gamedev/blob/main/libs/common/zmath.zig): fast, multi-platform, SIMD math library ("This release brings matrix operations, quaternion operations and much improved API. I wrote short [article about it here](https://zig.news/michalz/fast-multi-platform-simd-math-library-in-zig-2adn)")
* [6 zig-gamedev samples / intro applications](https://github.com/michal-z/zig-gamedev/tree/main/samples/intro), "Learn low-level graphics programming, game programming and zig-gamedev framework. Intro applications have been designed for learning purposes, I try to keep code as simple as possible and comment new functionality added in each subsequent program." - some very cool screenshots in here!
