# Unicode

Zig has, thus far, taken a lighter weight stance on Unicode - there are no native unicode types in the language and the standard library is light weight in terms of Unicode support.

Unicode is a complex: even in languages such as Go (by the same creators as UTF-8 itself) there is still regular confusion and subtle bugs lurking behind [invalid assumptions about what runes/code-points and grapheme clusters actually are](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/o1o5hr/fyi_a_single_go_rune_is_not_the_same_as_a_single/). Most modern languages suffer from this foot-gun (with [Swift being perhaps the most notable _exception_](https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/unicode-sorting-why-browsers-added-special-emoji-matching#swifts-default-is-not-locale-aware-but-unicode-support-is-notable).)

People in the Zig community, myself included, care about Unicode support immensely, though. [@jecolon](https://github.com/jecolon) has been working tirelessly on two libraries:

* [Ziglyph](https://github.com/jecolon/ziglyph): Unicode text processing for the Zig Programming Language.
* [Zigstr](https://github.com/jecolon/zigstr): A UTF-8 string type - which exposes primarily Grapheme clusters to avoid the mentioned foot-gun.

As well as a series of articles:

* [Part 1: Unicode basics in Zig](https://zig.news/dude_the_builder/unicode-basics-in-zig-dj3)
* [Part 2: Ziglyph Unicode wrangling](https://zig.news/dude_the_builder/ziglyph-unicode-wrangling-llj)
* [Part 3: Unicode string operations](https://zig.news/dude_the_builder/unicode-string-operations-536e)

[@andrewrk](https://github.com/andrewrk) and [@jecolon](https://github.com/jecolon) are also [working together](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/234#issuecomment-922065852) to ensure Zig's `std.unicode` library is a reasonable API in general before Zig 1.0.

# Android support

[@MasterQ32 has created a Zig android template repository](https://github.com/MasterQ32/ZigAndroidTemplate) - showing off how to create a minimal Android app in Zig.

Also see his earlier 2021 FOSDEM talk: [Create an Android Application with Zig](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/zig_android/) - I've included a short clip of the demo within for your enjoyment:

<video width="480px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/134788433-811ce689-ed38-40d3-8fda-09f5364e9734.mov" controls="controls" muted="muted">

Felix also has aspirations to do Zig-on-iOS work, so please [consider sponsoring him](https://github.com/sponsors/MasterQ32) for some Apple hardware if his work appeals to you!

# Test your C code with Zig

[@Pixeli](https://twitter.com/TommiSinivuo) on Twitter has shared an extremely cool topic: [how to easily test your existing C code using Zig](https://twitter.com/TommiSinivuo/status/1432393016761856003).

# IUP (cross platform GUI) for Zig

Rafael Batiati has shared a very interesting article: [IUP for Zig](https://zig.news/batiati/iup-for-zig-4ah):

> It's a cross-platform GUI toolkit developed by PUC-RIO, the same university behind the excellent Lua language.

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/134789187-8e3eddef-30e2-4fd7-b296-eb4de0f911f1.png"><img width="480px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/134789187-8e3eddef-30e2-4fd7-b296-eb4de0f911f1.png"></img></a>

# Robinhood hash tables

[Kenta Iwasaki](https://github.com/lithdew) shared their robin hash table implementation:

> A robin hood hash table that keeps entries lexicographically sorted. Assumes that keys are 256-bit cryptographic hashes. Able to insert 25.8 million entries per second, query 30.83 million entries per second, and delete 24.21 million entries per second.
> 
> Using it as one of the core main-memory data structures for a blockchain I'm writing in Zig called Rheia. Wrote and improved upon the data structure based on Twitter comments and articles made by Per Vognsen and Paul Khuong.
> 
> Beats any other sorted data structure I've benchmarked so far in terms of insertion/query/deletion throughput by 3-4x order of magnitudes.
> 
> https://github.com/lithdew/rheia/blob/master/hash_map.zig 

# Slingworks engine & Underburrow game

> _Underburrow is a speed running platformer game where you gather momentum with well timed button taps_

[@JonSnowbd shares _Slingworks 0.1_](https://github.com/JonSnowbd/slingworks): a simple and powerful Windows+Linux 'bring your content' engine built in Zig, as well as [Underburrow](https://github.com/JonSnowbd/underburrow): an all encompassing example for how Slingworks development works.

# Fast LRU cache

Also brought to us by [Kenta Iwasaki](https://github.com/lithdew):

> Wrote a really fast LRU cache that is an amalgamation of both a robin hood hash table and a doubly-linked deque.
> 
> On my laptop, with a max load factor of 50%, roughly:
> 
> - 19.81 million entries can be upserted per second.
> - 20.19 million entries can be queried per second.
> - 9.97 million entries can be queried and removed per second.
>
> The code is available here w/ unit tests and benchmarks: https://github.com/lithdew/rheia/blob/master/lru.zig

# Ray tracing in a weekend

[@Jack-Ji has implemented](https://github.com/Jack-Ji/ray-tracing-weekend.zig) the famous [ray-tracing-in-a-weekend](https://raytracing.github.io) in Zig:
