# Announcing zigmonthly.org

Today, I am launching zigmonthly.org: a once-a-month publication where I curate all things Zig that I’ve seen since the past month from the Zig Discord channels, <a href="https://zig.news">zig.news</a>, Twitter, Reddit, etc. and do my best to come up with a nice showcase. <a href="/about">Learn more</a>

# Zig cross compiling to iOS? Yes please!

Nearly matching up with [Zig's 6th birthday](https://twitter.com/andy_kelley/status/1424163667306631168), [@kubkon](https://github.com/kubkon) (a core team member and author of Zig's MachO linker) has begun [adding minimal support for building iOS binaries with Zig, from any OS](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/9532). Here's one running in the iOS emulator on a Mac:

# Tree Sitter for Zig

[@maxxnino](https://github.com/maxxnino) has released a [tree sitter parser for Zig](https://github.com/maxxnino/tree-sitter-zig).

([Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) is a parsing framework from GitHub used for a variety of editors and IDEs, such as [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/doc/treesitter) and OniVim for code navigation and syntax highlighting. It's also used by static analysis tools like [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) and powers GitHub's code navigation features - so having an implementation for Zig could prove quite useful!)

# A twin stick shooter

@unvestigate [shared in the Zig discord](https://discord.com/channels/605571803288698900/605572611539206171/873274345160589392) a video of their twin stick shooter they began building four days ago, with all gameplay code in Zig:

# Prometheus-style metrics for your Zig applications

[@vrischmann](https://github.com/vrischmann) released [a library](https://github.com/vrischmann/zig-prometheus) that enables one to add Prometheus-inspired counters, gauges, and histograms to their Zig applications - for use primarily with [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics), a Prometheus alternative.

# Positron - a web renderer frontend for Zig applications

[@MasterQ32](https://github.com/MasterQ32) has released [Positron](https://github.com/ziglibs/positron), a web renderer frontend for Zig applications. These Zig bindings to the popular [webview](https://github.com/webview/webview) library, enable one to write cross-platform HTML5 UI applications:

# zigmod

[@nektro](https://github.com/nektro) continues her work on [zigmod](https://github.com/nektro/zigmod), a package manager for the Zig programming language - this month releasing v67 for various bug fixes. The project has now hit over 500 commits and 3.6k lines of code, when you add in the fact that zigmod uses a few handfuls of Zig dependencies - I think it's an interesting large Zig project.

I should also note an [official Zig package manager is planned](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/943).

# A simple Karaoke player

# A path tracer

[@msinilo](https://github.com/msinilo) shares [a detailed write-up](http://msinilo.pl/blog2/post/zig-pathtracer/) and their experience implementing a simple ray tracer in Zig - with no prior Zig experience!

> "I’ve to admit I went in completely ‘blind’, didn’t know much about the language other than some passing remarks posted on Twitter. I kinda expected another Rust, so initially was a bit put off by how “Spartan” Zig was. After I adjusted and started taking it for what it was – a modern “C+” alternative – it actually became a very fun experiment."
